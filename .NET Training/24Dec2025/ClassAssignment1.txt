On the next day of class, the trainer gave an introduction in the concept of constructors to his students. The trainer tasked the students with developing a library management system using the constructor concept. As part of the system, the students need to implement a Book class that stores the book details, including the title, author, and number of pages. The Book class should have a constructor that initializes the book details upon creation.
 Help them to complete the task using your C# coding skills.
Functionalities:
In class Book, implement the below-given fields, constructors and methods.
    Data Type
  Field Name
    string
  title
    string
  author
    int
  numPages
    DateTime
  dueDate
    DateTime
  returnedDate
    Constructor 
   Description
    Default Constructor
 In the class Book implement the default constructor.
    Parameterized Constructor
 In the class Book implement the  Parameterized  constructor for assigning values to book class fields.
In this constructor, pass the parameters in the below-given order.
title, author, numPages, dueDate, returnedDate
    Method
   Description
   public double AveragePagesReadPerDay(int daysToRead)
 This method is used to find the average number of pages read per day and return it.
   public double CalculateLateFee(double dailyLateFeeRate)
 This method is used to calculate the late fee amount and return it.
 Formula :
Average Pages Read Per Day = numPages / daysToRead
Late Fee = Number of days late * dailyLateFeeRate
Number of days late = returnedDate - dueDate
In Program class - Main method,
1.    Get the values from the user as per the Sample Input.
2.   Call the methods accordingly and display the result as per the Sample Output.
Note:
Keep the methods and classes as public.
Please read the method rules clearly.
Do not use Environment.Exit() to terminate the program.
Do not change the given code template.
Summary :
Through working on this task, they have learned about constructors in C#.
Constructors in C# are special methods that are called when an object of a class is created. They are used to initialize the object's fields and properties to default or specific values.
Sample Input :
Enter the title
A TIME TO KILL
Enter the author
John Grisham
Enter the number of pages
500
Enter the due date
04/20/2023
Enter the return date
04/24/2023
Enter the days to read
150
Enter the daily late feeRate
30
Sample Output :
Average Pages Read Per Day : 3
Late Fee : 120
