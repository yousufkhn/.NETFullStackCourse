Serialization - 
1. Binary - (fastest) , for same domain
2. XML - for different domain
3. SOAP - Simple object access protocol, cross domain/entities, 
4. JSON - modern lightweight, web

Make the class serializable, fields or properties that are sensitive - mark them [non serialized]
Opt out model, marking the field we don't need as non serializable
