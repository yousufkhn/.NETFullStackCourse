Sam is planning to buy a laptop or a computer from Bejoy Computers. The final price of the selected device will depend on the type of processor and any additional accessories added to the purchase. To facilitate this process, an application will be used to gather input from the user regarding their preferred processor type and accessories, and subsequently calculate the total price of the selected device.
 Help them to create an application using your C# coding skills.

    Method
   Description
   public double LaptopPriceCalculation()
 This method is used to calculate the price of the laptop and return it.
To calculate the price of the laptop, the processor and other accessories prices are given below.
Formula 1:
Desktop Price = Processor Cost + (RamSize * Ram Price) + (HardDiskSize * Hard Disk Price) + (GraphicCard * Graphic Card Price) + (MonitorSize * Monitor Price) + (PowerSupplyVolt * Power Supply Volt Price);
    Processor
   Processor Cost
    i3
  1500
    i5
  3000
    i7
  4500
   Ram price (per GB)
  Hard disk (per TB)
  Graphic Card (per GB)
  Power supply (per Volt)
  Monitor (per inch)
    200
   1500
   2500
   20
 250
Formula 2:
Laptop Price = Processor Cost + (RamSize * Ram Price) + (HardDiskSize * Hard Disk Price) + (GraphicCard * Graphic Card Price) + (Display Size* Display Price) + (BatteryVolt * Battery Volt Price);
    Processor
   Processor Cost
    i3
  2500
    i5
  5000
    i7
  6500
  Ram price (per GB)
  Hard disk (per TB)
 Graphic Card (per GB)
 Battery(per Volt)
 Display(per inch)
    200
   1500
   2500
   20
 250
Note:
Processor is Case-sensitive.
In Program class - Main method,
1.    Get the values from the user as per the Sample Input.
2.    Call the methods accordingly and display the result as per the Sample Output.
Note:
Keep the properties, methods and classes as public.
Please read the method rules clearly.
Do not use Environment.Exit() to terminate the program.
Do not change the given code template.
Summary :
Through creating this application, they have learned about Inheritance in C#.
Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from a parent class, thus avoiding code duplication and promoting code reuse.
